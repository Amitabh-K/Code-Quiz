## Getting Started

Build a timer-based quiz application that stores high scores client-side.

```

A timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that one can gauge one's progress compared to his/her peers.

### Content based on use case

The user will be prompted to choose one form the two set of quiz:

  * Time allowed is one minute
  * 5 quesions to answer

  * Play proceeds as follows:

  * The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz." Also note the navigation option to "View Highscores" and the "Time" value set at 0.

  * Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins countdown.

  * Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (for example, 15 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).

  * When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. Their final score and initials are then stored in `localStorage`.

  ```

  ### Above all
 * Added audio files to alert the user of correct or incorrect answers
 * This is a responsive web app (using Bootstrap)
